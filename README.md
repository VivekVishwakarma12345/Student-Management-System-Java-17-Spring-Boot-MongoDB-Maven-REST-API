üöÄ **Project Title & Tagline**

**Project Title:** MongoDB-Java-Project
**Tagline:** A Spring Boot application that integrates Java and MongoDB to build a robust and scalable database-driven application.

üìñ **Description**

MongoDB-Java-Project is a Spring Boot application that showcases the integration of Java and MongoDB. This project demonstrates how to use Java to interact with a MongoDB database, leveraging the power of Spring Boot to simplify the development process. The application provides a robust and scalable infrastructure for building database-driven applications.

The project consists of several key components, including:

* A Java-based Spring Boot application that interacts with a MongoDB database
* A MongoDB database that stores data in a NoSQL format
* A set of Java classes that define the data model and business logic for the application
* A Spring Boot configuration file that sets up the application's configuration and dependencies

‚ú® **Features**

1. **MongoDB Integration**: The application uses Spring Data MongoDB to interact with a MongoDB database, allowing for seamless integration with the NoSQL database.
2. **Spring Boot Configuration**: The application uses Spring Boot's configuration file to set up the application's configuration and dependencies, making it easy to customize and extend the application.
3. **Java-Based Data Model**: The application defines a Java-based data model that represents the data stored in the MongoDB database, making it easy to work with the data using Java.
4. **Business Logic**: The application includes a set of Java classes that define the business logic for the application, allowing for complex data processing and manipulation.
5. **API Endpoints**: The application provides a set of API endpoints that can be used to interact with the MongoDB database, making it easy to integrate with other applications.
6. **Error Handling**: The application includes error handling mechanisms to ensure that the application remains robust and scalable in the event of errors or exceptions.
7. **Logging**: The application includes logging mechanisms to ensure that the application's performance and behavior can be monitored and tracked.
8. **Security**: The application includes security mechanisms to ensure that the application remains secure and protected from unauthorized access.

üìÅ **Project Structure**

The project consists of the following folders and files:

* `JDBC_MongoDB_JAVA`: The main project folder that contains all the Java classes, configuration files, and other project-related files.
* `JDBC`: A subfolder within `JDBC_MongoDB_JAVA` that contains the Java classes that define the data model and business logic for the application.
* `Model`: A subfolder within `JDBC` that contains the Java classes that define the data model for the application.
* `Repository`: A subfolder within `JDBC` that contains the Java classes that define the data repository for the application.
* `Services`: A subfolder within `JDBC` that contains the Java classes that define the business logic for the application.
* `Controllers`: A subfolder within `JDBC` that contains the Java classes that define the API endpoints for the application.
* `pom.xml`: The Maven configuration file that sets up the project's dependencies and build process.

‚öôÔ∏è **How to Run**

To run the application, follow these steps:

1. Clone the project repository using Git.
2. Install the project dependencies using Maven by running the command `mvn install`.
3. Run the application using the command `mvn spring-boot:run`.
4. Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080` to access the application's API endpoints.

üß™ **Testing Instructions**

To test the application, follow these steps:

1. Clone the project repository using Git.
2. Install the project dependencies using Maven by running the command `mvn install`.
3. Run the application using the command `mvn spring-boot:run`.
4. Use a tool like Postman or cURL to send requests to the application's API endpoints.
5. Verify that the application responds correctly to the requests and returns the expected data.
